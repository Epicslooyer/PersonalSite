* Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
* Do not add any comments to the code. The code should be readable instead. Code should be readable (clear logical structure, maintainable using smaller helper functions/files, and easy to write unit tests for)
* Break down problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
* Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.

* Simplicity is key, avoid using overcomplex solutions.
